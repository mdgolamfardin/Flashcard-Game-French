# French-Word-Flash

Welcome to the French-Word-Flash repository! This project is designed to help users learn French vocabulary through a digital flashcard application built with Python. It presents words in French and asks the user to recall the English translation, providing feedback based on the accuracy of the user's response.

## Project Structure

This repository includes the following files and directories:

- `main.py` - The main Python script that runs the flashcard application.
- `data/` - Contains CSV files with French and English vocabulary:
  - `french_words.csv` - Primary file with French words and their English translations.
  - `french_words_backup.csv` - Backup file for the vocabulary list.
- `images/` - Contains images used in the flashcard interface:
  - `card_front.png` - Front of the flashcard displaying the French word.
  - `card_back.png` - Back of the flashcard displaying the English translation.
  - `right.png` - Icon displayed when the answer is correct.
  - `wrong.png` - Icon displayed when the answer is incorrect.

## Features

- **Interactive Flashcards**: Click through flashcards to view French words and test your knowledge by recalling the English translation.
